  <div class="subpoint">
    <p><strong>1.1.</strong> The purpose of this Data Protection Policy is to protect the <q>rights and freedoms</q> of natural persons (i.e. living individuals) and to ensure that personal data is not processed without their knowledge, and, wherever possible, that it is processed with their consent, according to the GDPR Regulation (EU) 2016/679, referred <span class="underline">hereinunder</span> as <span class="highlight">'GDPR'</span>.</p>

    <p><strong>1.2.</strong> Definitions used by the <span class="highlight-yellow">CODE LINK</span>, <span class="underline">hereinunder</span> referred to as <span class="highlight">'Organisation'</span>:</p>
    <p><strong>Material scope (Article 2)</strong> – the GDPR applies to the processing of personal data wholly or partly by automated means (i.e. by computer) and to the processing other than by automated means of personal data (i.e. paper records) that form part of a filing system or are intended to form part of a filing system.</p>
    <p><strong>Territorial scope (Article 3)</strong> – the GDPR will apply to all controllers that are established in the EU who process the personal data of data subjects, in the context of that establishment. It will also apply to controllers outside of the EU that process personal data to offer goods and services or monitor the behaviour of data subjects who are residents in the EU.</p>
    <p><strong>1.3.</strong>Article 4 definitions</p>
    <p>Establishment – the main establishment of the controller in the EU will be the place in which the controller makes the main decisions as to the purpose and means of its data processing activities. The main establishment of a processor in the EU will be its administrative centre. If a controller is base outside the EU, it will have to appoint a representative in the jurisdiction in which the controller operates to act on behalf of the controller and deal with supervisory authorities.
        <p>Personal data – any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person (‘data subject’); an identifiable natural person is one who can be identified, directly or indirectly by reference to an identifier such as a name, an identification number, location data, an online identifier or to one or more factors specific to the physical, physiological, genetic, mental, economic, cultural, or social identity of that natural person.</p>
       <p>Special categories of personal data – revealing racial or ethnic origin, political opinions, religious or philosophical beliefs, or trade union membership, and the processing of genetic data, biometric data for the purpose of uniquely identifying a natural person, data concerning health or data concerning a natural person’s sex life or sexual orientation.</p>
        <p>Data controller – the natural or legal person, public authority, agency, or other body which, alone or jointly with other, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data; where the purposes and means of such processing are determined by Union or Member State law, the controller or the specific criteria for its nomination may be provided for by Union or Member State law.</p>
       <p> Data subject – any living individual who is the subject of personal data held by an organisation.</p>
        <p>Processing – any operation or set of operations which is performed on personal data or on sets of personal data, whether or not by automated means, such as collection, recording, organisation, structuring, storage, adaptation or alteration, retrieval, consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination or otherwise making available, alignment or combination, restriction, erasure or destruction.</p>
        <p>Profiling – is any form of automated processing of personal data intended to evaluate certain personal aspects relating to a natural person, or to analyse or predict that person’s performance at work, economic situate, location, health, personal preferences, reliability, or behaviour. This definition is linked to the right of the data subject to object to profiling and a right to be informed about the existence of profiling, of measure based on profiling and the envisaged effects of profiling on the individual.</p>
       <p> Personal data breach – a breach of security leading to the accidental, or unlawful, destruction, loss, alteration, unauthorised disclosure of, or access to, personal data transmitted, stored, or otherwise processed. There is an obligation on the controller to report personal data breeches to the supervisory authority and where the breach is likely to adversely affect the personal data or privacy of the data subject.</p>
       <P> Data subject consent – means any freely given, specific, informed, and unambiguous indication of the data subject’s wishes by which he or she, by a statement or by a clear affirmative action, signifies agreement to the processing of personal data.</P>

                            <p><strong>10.1.1.</strong>.An adequacy decision 
The European Commission can and does not assess third countries, a territory and/or specific sectors within third countries to assess whether there is an appropriate level of protection for the rights and freedoms of natural persons. In these instances, no authorisation is required.
A list of countries that currently satisfy the adequacy requirements of the Commission are published in the Official Journal of the European Union, <a  href="http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm" target="_blank"> http://ec.europa.eu/justice/data-protection/international-transfers/adequacy/index_en.htm</a></p>
<p><strong>10.1.2.</strong>Privacy Shield 
<p>If Organisation wishes to transfer personal data from the EU to an organisation in the United States it should check that the organisation is signed up with the Privacy Shield framework at the U.S. Department of Commerce. The obligation applying to companies under the Privacy Shield are contained in the “Privacy Principles”. The US DOC is responsible for managing and administering the Privacy Shield and ensuring that companies live up to their commitments. To be able to certify, companies must have a privacy policy in line with the Privacy Principles e.g. use, store and further transfer the personal data according to a strong set of data protection rules and safeguards. The protection given to the personal data applied regardless of whether the personal data is related to an EU resident or not. Organisations must renew their “membership” to the Privacy Shield on an annual basis. If they do not, they can no longer receive and use personal data from the EU under that framework.
Assessment of adequacy by the data controller
In assessing adequacy, the UK based exporting controller should take account of the following factors:</p>                       
<ul>
    <li>The nature of the information being transferred.</li>
<li>The country or territory of the origin, and destination, of the information.</li>
<li>How the information will be used and for how long.</li>
<li>The laws and practices of the country of the transferee, including relevant codes of practice and international obligations.</li>
<li>The security measures that are to be taken as regards the data in the overseas location</li></ul>
<p><strong>10.1.3.</strong>Binding corporate rules.
Organisation may adopt approved binding corporate rules for the transfer of data outside the EU. This requires submission to the relevant supervisory authority for approval of the rules that Organisation is seeking to rely upon.</p>
<p><strong>10.1.4.</strong>Model contract clauses.
Organisation may adopt approved model contract clauses for the transfer of data outside of the EEA. If Organisation adopts the model contract clauses approved by the relevant supervisory authority, there is an automatic recognition of adequacy.</p>
<p><strong>10.1.5.</strong>Exceptions.
In the absence of an adequacy decision, Privacy Shield membership, binding corporate rules and/or model contract clauses, a transfer of personal data to a third country or international organisation shall only take place on one of the following conditions:</p>
<ul>
    <li>The data subject has explicitly consented to the proposed transfer, after having been informed of the possible risks of such transfers for the data subject due to the absence of an adequacy decision and appropriate safeguards.</li>
<li>The transfer is necessary for the performance of a contract between the data subject and the Controller, or the implementation of pre-contractual measures taken at the data subject’s request.</li>
<li>The transfer is necessary for the conclusion or performance of a contract concluded in the interest of the data subject between the controller and another natural or legal person.</li>
<li>The transfer is necessary for important reasons of public interest.</li>
<li>The transfer is necessary for the establishment, exercise or defence of legal claims.</li> 
<li>The transfer is necessary to protect the vital interests of the data subject or of other persons, where the data subject is physically or legally incapable of giving consent.</li>
</ul>
<h1>11.Information asset register/data inventory</h1>
<p><strong>11.1</strong>.Organisation has established a data inventory and data flow process as part of its approach to address risks and opportunities throughout its GDPR compliance project. Organisation’s data inventory and data flow determines (GDPR DOC 2.4, and GDPR REC 4.4):</p>
